# $LFV - LambosForVirgins

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure you're using the project's node version by running:

```bash
nvm use
```

Then install the dependencies:

> We recommend using yarn because of it's cache optimization and dependency management. But if you prefer to fill your hard drive with node modules, then be sure to use `npm install` instead.

```bash
yarn
```

Finally, start the server with the same package manager you used to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
